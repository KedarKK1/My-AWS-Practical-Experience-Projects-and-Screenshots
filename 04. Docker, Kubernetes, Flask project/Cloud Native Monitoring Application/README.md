pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```
docker build "/home/kedar/Desktop/AWS Practicals/My-AWS-Practical-Experience-Projects-and-Screenshots/04. Docker, Kubernetes, Flask project/Cloud Native Monitoring Application"
# docker build -t my-flask-app .
```

```
docker run -p 5000:5000 img_id // meaning when container is running, it should work on 5000 in my localhost as well
